These custom nodes provide support for model files stored in the GGUF format popularized by llama.cpp.\nWhile quantization wasn't feasible for regular UNET models (conv2d), transformer/DiT models such as flux seem less affected by quantization. This allows running it in much lower bits per weight variable bitrate quants on low-end GPUs."
